            informed or believe that there is a dispute involving a third party who owns or controls funds in the account, we may:
          </p>
          <p>
            10.2.1. Put a hold on your Account in line with any law, regulation or regulatory directive and refuse to pay out any funds
            until we are satisfied that the dispute has ended.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.2.2. Send the funds to the person who we have good reason to believe is legally entitled to them either by mutual consent
            of parties or a Court Order;
          </p>
          <p>
            10.2.3. Continue to rely on the current records we hold about you; apply for a court order; or take any other action we feel
            is necessary to protect the Bank.
          </p>
          <p>10.2.4. Where the Bank acted according to the above, we are not liable to you for taking any of the above steps.</p>
